description: Get started with the Kelvin Mai's component registry for Shadcn UI.
---

Welcome to my personal [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) component registry! This is a collection of reusable UI components built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS, designed to accelerate your development workflow.

> shadcn/ui is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform. Works with your favorite frameworks and AI models. Open Source. Open Code.
> This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.

This is built on top of shadcn/ui and includes many useful components. The same as shadcn/ui, all components are free to use for personal and commercial. Just copy and paste to your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

## Getting Started

To start using this registry, you must first have shadcn installed in your project. Follow the [installation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) instructions if necessary.
