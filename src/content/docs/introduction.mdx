description: Get started with the Kelvin Mai's component registry for Shadcn UI.
---

Welcome to my personal [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) component registry! This is a collection of reusable UI components built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS, designed to accelerate your development workflow.

## Why use this registry?

- **Based on `shadcn/ui`:** Leverages the power and flexibility of `shadcn/ui`.
- **Consistency:** Ensures a consistent look and feel across all your projects and leverages [shadcn's theming framework](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming).
- **Customization:** Like shadcn/ui all of these components are easily customizable to match your project's specific branding and design by manually updating Tailwind CSS classes.

## Getting Started

To start using this registry, you must first have shadcn installed in your project. Follow the [installation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) instructions if necessary.
